you can run the python files just by clicking on them (normally I use idle and run module)

to start the server, run "main.py"

to add client connections, run "open_client.py"

as of now, there is no indication to each client who is sending what message, that functionality I plan to add in the coming days. But there can be as many client connections as needed. Might impliment a limit in coming days though.

I did not turn in design documents on time :( - but I included them in this submission :)

its a mixture of an EER and a UML lol
